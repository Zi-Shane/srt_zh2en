00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
Hello. I'm in Sokotai.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,000
I took the car yesterday at 9:00 p.m.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,840
The bus stop over here at 4:00 a.m.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,240
I met a great aunt in the car.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,060
She called me a cab. It's a motorcycle.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,000
Take me to where I live now.

7
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:31,400
I was actually asleep.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Maybe find something to eat.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,300
Then we'll go to Ancient City for a little bit.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,200
I just washed my hair.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Wash your face, bathe your face.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
All right, let's go.

13
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm in.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,000
The bike I borrowed from the door.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here it is.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,040
This is the bike I borrowed.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,000
30 bucks.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's just a normal car. There's no speed change.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
Because I can't read the map either.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't tell from that position.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone looks so much alike.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's the first thing I've ever seen.

23
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:49,977
It feels perfect.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
His leaves are so low.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know what it is.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,745
I'll rest here.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's a funny thing.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's the bike.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I just saw this sticker.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's why the Japanese don't want this car.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll give it back to you.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's still written on it.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Osaka P.D.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think so.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Looks like an old car, too.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But it's still a good ride.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's a big sun out there.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Maybe it's dryer.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm just feeling...

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's hot, but it's not coming.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've been sweating a lot.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Maybe I'll stay until night.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll probably find something to eat later.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's gonna be here till 9:00.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then there'll be lights.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then I'll hang around here.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just stay until the night.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The sun's smaller now.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The sun's smaller now.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I feel so much better.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a cold weather.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Otherwise, it's really hot in the morning.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then I'll go now.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Outside.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a long way from here.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a beautiful day.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can go up with this.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A lot of ants.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think so.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Whoo!

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's pigeons up there.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think there's a smell in there.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think we can do this bye-bye.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There's wax here.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's like people don't get here much better.

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,057
I'm wandering around.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,760
It's 4:30 p.m.

68
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,160
Let's go for a walk in the temple.

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
And then, actually,

70
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,400
It's hot though.

71
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,920
Thirty-three, thirty-four degrees of this weather.

72
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,480
But it's dryer here.

73
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,640
That's why it doesn't feel so uncomfortable.

74
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
In fact, it doesn't sweat in the sun.

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,600
It's just that you're gonna feel hot.

76
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,040
Maybe my clothes are black, too.

77
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,680
And then it gets hot.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,720
But it's not like you're sweaty and sticky.

79
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,480
I don't know why they all have one of these.

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Then we'll go with one.

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,880
This one seems to be working again.

82
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,160
The temple.

83
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't know what that is.

84
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
I wonder if it's possible.

85
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,000
The place where the ashes are laid.

86
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't know.

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
Go inside and take a look.

88
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,440
And then there's usually a lot of birds here.

89
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Then there'll be bird shit on the floor.

90
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I don't think so.

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
That's how it feels to climb up there.

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,480
I think it's beautiful.

93
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,920
It's like that big palace in Bangkok.

94
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
It's beautiful.

95
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
Get up there and take a look.

96
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
Ooh.

97
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
And lock it up.

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,120
I can't get this up.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
What's up there, $10,000?

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
Two hundred and fifty thousand.

101
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,840
And then the little one up there...

102
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
Thousands of dollars.

103
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm going now.

104
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,520
New City.

105
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,440
I think this is a quiet little city.

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,520
I think this is where the locals live.

107
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Maybe most tourists are on the side of History Park.

108
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,040
I don't know where everyone lives.

109
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,880
There's some hotels here too.

110
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,840
But I got a ride back yesterday.

111
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,280
I'm alone.

112
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't think there's anyone in line for a ride or anything like that.

113
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
And the coffee shop.

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,280
I don't know much about coffee, though.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Their laundry.

116
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,960
You have to take off your shoes. It's so special.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,560
It's six o'clock.

118
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,080
And then everybody's out on the street.

119
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,160
The chairs are out.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,000
Then someone's already eating.

121
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
They're roasting sausages.

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,240
Now it's sundown.

123
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,560
And now it's super hot in here.

124
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,360
We'll all be out selling at night.

125
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
It's hot in here, too.

126
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,040
And here's a coffee shop.

127
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
Then go over there and take a look.

128
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm back in my room.

129
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
I forgot to shoot first.

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,000
This one's a fried fish.

131
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
And then we'll have dinner.

132
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
And cucumbers.

133
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,480
And fish truffles and soup.

134
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,640
And this one's kind of similar.

135
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,800
That kind of life roll in Vietnam.

136
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
It's just a smaller one.

137
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
And this is the sauce.

138
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
It's kind of hot, too.

139
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,520
And he's got a lot of lettuce down there.

140
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
I think it's okay.

141
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,840
I think he's kind of like a Vietnamese dish.

142
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,040
Because he's got this.

143
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,680
When I was eating river powder in Vietnam,

144
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,720
The ones in the dish they gave me.

145
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,960
It's all the same.

146
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
And then I bought one of these.

147
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
Let's eat later.

148
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
It's supposed to be sweet.

149
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,880
It's like sugar or something.

150
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
And then he's gonna make a little bit of it.

151
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
I saw it in Bangkok.

152
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,480
All right, I'll eat.

153
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
I kind of can't eat it.

154
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
This sauce.

155
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,400
It's really hot.

156
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,000
I really can't stand it.

157
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,400
Then there's four more.

158
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,280
Let's keep it up.
